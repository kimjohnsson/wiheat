# Wi-Heat

Integrate HVAC sensor in Home Assistant through the Wi-Heat API.

## Description

This integration uses the wi-heat api to poll HVAC data in Home Assistant. The Wi-Heat API has been reversed-engendered using an IVT Nordic Inverter 12 PRN (work still in progress). **Currently it is only possible to get data from the HVAC system.**

## Installation

### Using HACS

This integration isn't yet added to the HACS store. But you can still add it to Home Assistant by following the [custom repositories instructions](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) using the repository link: `https://github.com/kimjohnsson/wiheat.git`.
